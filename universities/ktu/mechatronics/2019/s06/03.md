# MRT306: Industrial Hydraulics & Pneumatics  

## Course Objectives  

* Provide knowledge about various components of hydraulic and pneumatic systems.  
* Differentiate between hydraulic and pneumatic power systems.  
* Design and simulate fluid power systems for automation in machine tools and equipment.  
* Apply control systems (electrical, electronic, and PLC) to fluid power systems.  
* Solve engineering problems using fluid power principles.  
* Develop troubleshooting and maintenance skills for fluid power systems.  

## Course Content
