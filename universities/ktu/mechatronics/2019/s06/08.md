# MRT352: Industrial Engineering

## Course Objectives

* Understand the evolution and functions of Industrial Engineering and its role in productivity improvement.  
* Apply work study techniques, time study, and motion study for improving efficiency.  
* Analyze plant location, layout, material handling, and depreciation techniques.  
* Implement production planning, control, forecasting, and inventory management concepts.  
* Understand quality control, process capability, reliability, TQM, and replacement analysis.  
* Apply project management techniques like CPM and PERT in industrial contexts.  

## Course Content
