# MRT362: Design for Manufacturing

## Course Objectives

* Understand the general design principles for manufacturability.  
* Identify factors influencing form design and apply process capability concepts.  
* Apply design principles for casting, welding, brazing, and soldering.  
* Simplify design features to facilitate machinability, assembly, and disassembly.  
* Apply environmentally responsible design principles for energy efficiency and sustainability.  

## Course Content
