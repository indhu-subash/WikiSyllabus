## Course Objectives

* Introduce the fundamentals of operations research and its applications in engineering and management.  
* Formulate and solve linear programming problems using various techniques.  
* Apply transportation, assignment, queuing, and sequencing models in practical situations.  
* Implement project management techniques such as CPM and PERT for effective scheduling.  
* Analyze decision-making problems using game theory, simulation, and decision trees.
