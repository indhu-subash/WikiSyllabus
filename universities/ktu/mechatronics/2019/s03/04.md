# MRT205: Mechanics of Solids  

## Course Objectives  

* Determine the stresses, strains and displacements of structures by tensorial and graphical (Mohr’s circle) approaches.  
* Analyse the strength of materials using stress-strain relationships for structural and thermal loading.  
* Perform basic design of shafts subjected to torsional loading and analyse beams subjected to bending moments.  
* Determine the deformation of structures subjected to various loading conditions using strain energy methods.  
* Estimate the strength of thin cylinders, spherical vessels and columns, and appreciate the theories of failures and its relevance in mechanical design.
