# MAT201: Partial Differential Equations and Complex Analysis  

## Course Objectives  

* Understand the concept and the solution of partial differential equations.  
* Analyse and solve one-dimensional wave equation and heat equation.  
* Understand complex functions, their continuity and differentiability using Cauchy-Riemann equations.  
* Evaluate complex integrals using Cauchy’s integral theorem and formula; understand the series expansion of analytic functions.  
* Understand the series expansion of complex functions about a singularity and apply residue theorem to compute real integrals.  

## Course Content  

### Module - 1 (Partial Differential Equations)  

* Formation of PDEs – elimination of arbitrary constants and functions.  
* Solutions of PDEs – equations solvable by direct integration.  
* Linear equations of the first order – Lagrange’s linear equation.  
* Non-linear equations of the first order – Charpit’s method.  
* Solution by method of separation of variables.  

### Module - 2 (Applications of PDEs)  

* One-dimensional wave equation – derivation and solution by separation of variables.  
* Vibrations of a stretched string – D’Alembert’s solution.  
* One-dimensional heat equation – derivation and solution.  

### Module - 3 (Complex Variable: Differentiation)  

* Complex functions – limit, continuity, derivative, analytic functions.  
* Cauchy-Riemann equations, harmonic functions, harmonic conjugate.  
* Conformal mappings – \( w = z^2, w = e^z, w = \sin z, w = \frac{1}{z} \).  
* Linear fractional transformations – fixed points and mappings.  

### Module - 4 (Complex Variable: Integration)  

* Complex integration – line integrals in the complex plane, properties.  
* Methods of evaluation – indefinite integration and path representation.  
* Contour integrals – Cauchy integral theorem (without proof) for simply and multiply connected domains.  
* Cauchy integral formula (without proof), derivatives of analytic functions.  
* Taylor and Maclaurin series.  

### Module - 5 (Complex Variable: Residue Integration)  

* Laurent’s series (without proof), zeros of analytic functions.  
* Singularities – poles, removable and essential singularities.  
* Residues – Cauchy residue theorem (without proof).  
* Evaluation of definite integrals using residue theorem.  
* Residue integration of real integrals involving rational functions of sinθ and cosθ.
