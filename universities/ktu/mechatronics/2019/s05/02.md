# MRT303: Linear Control Systems

## Course Objectives

* Understand control systems in the design of dynamic systems.  
* Identify a set of equations for representing and modelling physical systems.  
* Perform analysis of control systems in time and frequency domains.  
* Analyse the stability of control systems.  
* Identify different controllers and compensation techniques.  
* Apply the knowledge of control systems in real-time control applications.  

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Principles of Automatic Control)

* Principle of automatic control – open loop and closed loop systems with examples.  
* System modelling and approximations.  
* Modelling of electrical systems – dynamic equations using KCL & KVL of RL, RC, and RLC circuits.  
* Transfer functions and development of block diagrams of simple electrical networks.  
* Block diagram reduction, signal flow graphs, Mason's gain formula.  

### Module - 2 (Modelling of Physical Systems)

* Modelling of translational and rotational mechanical systems.  
* Differential equations for mass, spring, and dashpot elements – D'Alembert’s principle.  
* Dynamic equations and transfer functions for typical mechanical systems.  
* Analogous systems: force-voltage & force-current analogy, torque-voltage & torque-current analogy.  
* Electromechanical systems.  
* Transfer function of armature-controlled DC motor and field-controlled DC motor.  

### Module - 3 (Time Domain Analysis)

* Continuous systems and standard test signals – step, ramp, parabolic, impulse.  
* Transient and steady-state response.  
* First-order systems – unit impulse and step responses.  
* Second-order systems – underdamped and overdamped response.  
* Time-domain specifications.  
* Steady-state error – static position, velocity, and acceleration error constants.  
* Control structures: PID control, feedforward, ratio control, predictive control.  

### Module - 4 (Stability and Frequency Domain Analysis)

* Concept of stability – relation to location of poles in S-plane.  
* Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion.
