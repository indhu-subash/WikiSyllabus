# MRT458: Supply Chain Management

## Course Objectives

* Illustrate features and models of various supply chains
* Apply tools for planning production operations in supply chains
* Apply techniques and models for inventory decisions in supply chains
* Illustrate tools and models for transportation network design decisions
* Understand decisions connected to supply chain cross-functional drivers

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Features and Models of Various Supply Chains)

* Supply Chain – Common features, objectives, structures, decision phases, performance measures, drivers, strategic fit and metrics.
* Major features of reverse, closed loop, green, lean, agile, le-agile, resilient, dual channel, and international supply chains.
* Introduction to supply chain models used for distribution networks, facility location, and facility layout.
* Performance measures and drivers in grocery and medicine supply chains.
* Facility location and distribution network optimization.

### Module - 2 (Planning of Production Operations in Supply Chains)

* Forecasting models for supply chains including seasonal models, forecast errors, and de-seasonalization.
* Aggregate production planning strategies and methods.
* Operations planning to respond to predictable variability using sequencing, scheduling, and line balancing.
* LP modelling for aggregate planning in production scenarios.

### Module - 3 (Inventory Planning Decisions in Supply Chains)

* Cycle inventory models, discounting models, multi-item inventory models, and production-consumption models.
* Safety inventory models for continuous and periodic review.
* Models, tools, and techniques for optimal product availability, bullwhip effect, and risk pooling.
* Replenishment policies and probabilistic demand inventory models.

### Module - 4 (Transportation Network Design Decisions in Supply Chains)

* Design options in transportation networks, trade-offs, and risk management.
* Allocation, routing, scheduling, and sequencing methods.
* Advanced techniques for scheduling and sequencing in transportation.
* Vehicle routing problem solutions and IT integration in transport networks.

### Module - 5 (Decisions on Supply Chain Cross Functional Drivers)

* Sourcing, outsourcing, 3PL, 4PL, supplier scoring, contracts, risk sharing, and design collaboration.
* Pricing and revenue management of multiple customer segments, perishable assets, bulk and spot contracts.
* IT framework for Indian supply chains.
* Supply chain coordination, managerial levers, obstacles, and their effect on performance.
