# MRT444: Metallurgy and Materials Engineering

## Course Objectives

- Understand the correlation between chemical bonds, crystal structure, and mechanical properties of metals.  
- Analyze microstructures using phase diagrams and modify properties via heat treatments.  
- Examine mechanisms of material failure through fatigue, creep, and superplasticity.  
- Apply ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy principles for material selection.  
- Differentiate engineering materials based on structure and properties.
