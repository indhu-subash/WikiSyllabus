# MRT456: Ergonomics

## Course Objectives

* Introduce principles of ergonomics and humanized systems.
* Apply anthropometry and body mechanics to design.
* Identify human factors in static and repetitive work.
* Analyse work-induced stress, fatigue, vision, and hearing considerations.
* Model human interaction with systems and improve workstation design.

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Introduction to Ergonomics)
