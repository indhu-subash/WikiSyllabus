# MRT446: Dynamics of Machinery

## Course Objectives

* Analyse forces in mechanisms and engines.
* Draw and interpret turning moment diagrams.
* Calculate unbalanced forces in rotating and reciprocating machines.
* Analyse gyroscopic effects and vehicle stability.
* Study free and forced vibrations of single degree of freedom (SDOF) systems.

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Force Analysis of Mechanisms)

* Static and dynamic force analysis of four-bar linkages (graphical and virtual work methods)
* D’Alembert’s principle and equivalent dynamic systems
* Force analysis in reciprocating engines: piston effort, connecting rod force, and side thrust

### Module - 2 (Turning Moment and Flywheels)

* Energy efficiency in rotating systems
* Flywheels: design and analysis
* Turning moment diagrams for steam engines, single and multi-cylinder IC engines
* Coefficient of fluctuation of speed and energy

### Module - 3 (Balancing of Machines)

* Static and dynamic balancing of rotating masses
* Balancing of single and multi-cylinder reciprocating engines
* Partial balancing and its effects
* Balancing of several masses in single and parallel planes

### Module - 4 (Gyroscopic Effects and Vehicle Stability)

* Gyroscopic couple: spin vector, precession vector, applied and reactive torque vectors
* Effects of gyroscopic couple on two-wheelers, four-wheelers, ships, and aircraft
* Stability analysis of vehicles

### Module - 5 (Vibrations)

* Free and forced vibrations of SDOF systems
* Equation of motion: Newton’s and energy methods
* Undamped and damped natural frequencies
* Logarithmic decrement
* Response of SDOF systems to harmonic excitation
* Whirling of shafts, vibration absorbers, and transmissibility
