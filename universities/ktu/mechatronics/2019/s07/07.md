## Course Objectives  

- Summarize the concepts of flow measurements and flow through pipes  
- Apply the momentum and energy equations to fluid flow problems  
- Evaluate head loss in pipes and conduits  
- Apply the knowledge of working of different turbines to select the suitable type of turbine for an application  
- Solve the centrifugal and reciprocating problems
