# EST110: Engineering Graphics

## Course Objectives

* To introduce the fundamentals of technical drawing relevant to engineering applications.
* To develop the ability to visualize and prepare orthographic and isometric projections of objects.
* To enable students to create sectional views, surface developments, and perspective projections.
* To familiarize students with CAD tools for solid modeling and orthographic views.

## Course Content

### Module - 1 (Introduction and Projection of Points and Lines)

* Relevance of technical drawing in engineering.
* Types of lines, dimensioning, BIS code of practice for technical drawing.
* Orthographic projection of points in different quadrants.
* Projection of straight lines inclined to one plane and to both planes.
* Trace of a line, inclination of lines with reference planes, true length of line inclined to both reference planes.

### Module - 2 (Orthographic Projection of Solids)

* Projection of simple solids such as triangular, rectangular, square, pentagonal, and hexagonal prisms, pyramids, cone, and cylinder.
* Projection of solids in simple positions including profile view.
* Projection of solids with axis inclined to one or both reference planes.

### Module - 3 (Sections and Development of Solids)

* Sections of prisms, pyramids, cone, and cylinder with axis in vertical position cut by different section planes.
* True shape of the sections and locating the section plane when the true shape is given.
* Development of surfaces of the above solids and solids cut by different section planes.
* Finding the shortest distance between two points on a surface.

### Module - 4 (Isometric Projection)

* Isometric view and projections of prisms, pyramids, cone, cylinder, frustum of pyramid, frustum of cone, sphere, hemisphere, and their combinations.

### Module - 5 (Perspective Projection and Conversion of Views)

* Perspective projection of prisms and pyramids with axis perpendicular to the ground plane or picture plane.
* Conversion of pictorial views into orthographic views.
